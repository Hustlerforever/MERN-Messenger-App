use $ npm start

#to move to frontend use cd messenger-frontend

#to avoid cohort error add "proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:5000", in package.json of the react app

#Our app is having multiple pages so we need to have react router dom 
 here we are using version 5 of the react router dom

$ npm install react-router-dom@5

# To use react router we have to enclose the app with <BrowserRouter> <BrowserRouter/>
   go to index.js and enclose the app
and also  import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";


# Now creating routes for home and chats page
